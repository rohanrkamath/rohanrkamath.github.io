### AutoML Tool 

Built a full-stack app using Flask. Used Redis as a broker to run heavy anomaly detection code in the background for Video Analysis. Used sqlalchemy as ORM to connect to a SQLite3 database to store user and project credentials, job IDs, etc. Implemented cross-cutting concerns like authorization, security and multi-tenancy.

### Galaxy Discord Bot

### Ajax Request Header Manipulation

Researched DOM-based attacks, specifically AJAX Request Header Manipulation vulnerabilities. Created a dummy website to emulate the attack, and to patch it up. Then proceeded to test this vulnerability on the college website.

### Ride Sharing App

The aim of this project was to build a few REST APIs for the RideShare Cabs app and to provide cloud architecture in implementing them.
